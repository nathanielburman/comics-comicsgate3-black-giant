Title: The Black Giant That Sleeps. The Black Giant is Awake. Giants Who Wore Chains.

Unfortunately, no community is safe, from them. Our enemies. They look just like us, they act just like us, hell, their children look just like ours. We need someone who looks different to do something different.

Different.

Music was split in half by someone. The politics seeped their way into the conversation. My girlfriend couldn't explain to me what a woman was anymore. My wife wouldn't even talk to me about it. I knew it was a problem. A problem that I needed a new girlfriend.

Black men gaining strength. Women lookin over at them wondering what they doing. Black men gaining strength, I said. Through having sexual intercourse with anyone who feels even the slightest urge to be with that giant... catch of a man, my man, your man. Black men are getting stronger.

What does any woman want in a man? Tall, dark, handsssssnake!

This White woman was agreeing with me and I called her a snake!

Listen closely and read these words very slowly: The black community is different. They have sexual relations with each other and their courtship rituals are more important than yours. So leave the community alone.

Black is NOT a sexuality. Black is a race. You can't comprehend what a White man goes through to try to pretend he is as cool as a Black man. Why Harley Quinn had some White Boy sucker in here the other day... no their white guilt (Project White Guilt to Joker) has control of them now.

What's the problem? Well, someone in this town made a Sex flag and they claim it is the homosexuals, and well someone went and made a big mistake by putting a black stripe on there that gay flag of white people's pride.

Black is NOT a sexuality. It is a race. It is a creed.

I have walked with Black Giants. I have been kicked in the back by their legs as they walk and I dodge and weave their calculus. I have seen the Black Giants on this Earth. I believe in Black Giants.

I discovered a trinity that may lead to more trinities of power.

Boys

The riddle goes like this:
Puffy = gay, Big Willie = gay, Eazy-E was never caught trippin hell no, but what about that case of HIV/AIDS.

The Oracle:
When I was just a kid in America, we admired the most talented musicians in the world. Some of the men we looked up to were gay. The music industry and the Hollywood film industry embraced diversity.

It's important to clarify that people didn't "go gay"; rather, they revealed their true selves by coming out of the closet. The closet used to symbolize a lack of freedom of expression. When someone stays in the closet, they hide their true identity, which can lead to dishonesty. However, when they come out, they may initially face the challenge of reconciling their past with their newfound authenticity. Eventually, with acceptance, they can take pride in being true to themselves.

As kids, we idolized influential figures like Big Willie, who commanded our attention through TV and music. Puffy Combs, known as Diddy, was also influential during that time. The term "Diddyer" is not clear in its meaning.

The worth of a real man cannot be measured solely in monetary terms. It is about their character, values, and positive influence on others. Role models who are not gay can have a significant impact on young people's lives. However, it's important to note that a person's sexual orientation does not diminish their worth or ability to influence others positively.

In the realm of magic, evolution, and technology, changes have occurred where women may transition to become men, and vice versa. Additionally, there are advancements that have led to diverse expressions of gender. It is worth noting that while these changes are possible, turning a man into a woman has not happened in this particular timeline.

In this timeline, the music industry is composed of diverse individuals, including those who are white and gay. There are also influential Black figures who coexist alongside their white counterparts. The mention of a "L" in front seems unclear in its connection to shielding one's sexual orientation.

It is important to foster a respectful and inclusive dialogue, promoting understanding and acceptance of diverse identities and experiences.

When I was just a kid in America we liked the hottest musicians on Earth, the best ones. The men we looked up to were gay. The music industry went gay. the movie holywood industrial complex went gay.

HATE SPEECH.

It's not true that they went gay. They just came out of the closet. There is a FREE SPEECH platform called the Closet. If you stay in the closet your gay still but hiding the truth, a liar. Now, but if you come out of the closet you are a hypocrite still for having been in the closet at all. Once everyone knows you are a hypocrite, then you can feel Pride. But you must maintain the hypocrisy or your pride will change its form of energy.

The kids looked up to Big Willie. A Big Willie in the TV. And a Big Willie in our ears. Puffy Comps went by little Diddy at the time. What is a Diddyer?

What is a real man worth? How much money do the kids need to pay for a (NOT GAY) Man to be able to influence them? Where are all the (NOT GAY) men?

Somehow, using magic, evolution and technology, ''they' have turned women in to men and they have turned men into mutant men and they have turned women into mutant women. but they will never turn a man into a woman, it just never happened in this time line.

In this time line. The music industry is taken over by a WHITE GAY enemy. The Black Giants walk among the White Giants. Proof: they put a L in front to shield the Gay.

L stands mighty in front and shields G which includes the B and we are protecting the T...

When did Death make her impact on the Black Giants in Rap Music? When did 36 Mafia introduce the horror & Death into the scene? When did they win their music award? As a contingency plan. Incase, things went in a go-with-the-flow kind of way, and Rap became happy. Murder, Music, & Pride. Versus. Education, Authority, Pride.
